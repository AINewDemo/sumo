# SUMO
SUMO is a Java software package to perform ship detection on satellite SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images. 
It takes as main input a SAR images and its metadata, and produces as main output a list of detected ships with their attributes. 
The SUMO software is experimental. It was made for research purposes, not for operational use. 
SUMO implements the "SUMO algorithm" that has been described in detail in Greidanus et al., 2017 (doi:10.3390/rs9030246). 

### Project Organization
SUMO is organised as a Maven project with several subprojects:

    • Sumo
        ◦ SumoCore
            It contains the classes to manage the platform configuration

        ◦ GeoImageViewer
            This project manages the GUI and in particular:
                        ▪ Image loading
                        ▪ Analysis processes
                        ▪ Import/export operations

        ◦ GeoImage
            It contains the classes to load all types of images

        ◦ GeoImageAnalysis
            It contains the algorithms to analyze the images

        ◦ SentinelXMLReader
            This project is a library used by GeoImage to read the Sentinel-1 images

        ◦ GeoLocation
            This project is a library that implements a Geolocation Algorithm. It is used 
            to convert coordinates into image pixels and back

### Installation
SUMO doesn’t need to be actually installed, it’s enough to copy the SUMO folder (downloaded from the releases page 
and then unzipped) on your system. 
SUMO requires JRE (or JDK) 1.7.x or above. If you don't want to install a new Java version, you could simply copy  
the JRE folder in your SUMO folder.

### Run SUMO
SUMO can run in two ways, interactive mode (with GUI) and batch mode. The batch mode requires a configuration file 
as explained in the manual.

To run in interactive mode use start.sh for Linux and start.bat for Windows.
    
To use the batch mode use start_batch.sh for Linux and start_batch.bat for Windows.
